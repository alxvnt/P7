Grand Py Bot

This the 7th project of my Openclassrooms Path "Python Developer".

Grand Py Bot is a web application which answer at your questions about a place.

## Requirement

You need an API Key of Google Map. You can get one [here](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/).

Then, you have to replace the Word APIKEY in the file index.html and in the file map.py.

## How to use it

Just write a simple question in french in the form like 'Montre moi la tour eiffel'.

GrandPyBot will show you the address, the map and some quote about this place from Wikipedia.
